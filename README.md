# OH-no-Type-Company-font-ex

Just some basic html scraping.
It will simply extracts fonts from the site so you can download them.
I personally made it to get Vulf Sans and Vulf Mono.
You can take other fonts by editting the script by the `target` variable

If using the webpage instead of python, make sure to disable popups for the downloads...
